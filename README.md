# LTRRTLCSS

Left to right and right to left CSS

Based on original [rtlcss](https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss).  
The tool will extract the part which is concerned with left to right or right to left, and create two new css rule prefixed with .ltr and .rtl. The parts which has nothing to do with ltr, rtl remain unchanged in the original rule.

See an example here:
